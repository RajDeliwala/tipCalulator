# tipCalulator
Basic calculator I made with python because I wanted to practice 
After going out to eat with co-workers a lot we were always wasting a lot of time determing how much each person owed.
I made a python program that takes in the amount of people at the table, each persons raw total, the sub total, and the total with tip.
It then outputs the splits per person.
